  - Configured Chrome options for stability
  - Added user-agent spoofing to avoid detection
  - Implemented window maximization for CAPTCHA visibility
  - Set up proper WebDriver instance management

- **12:20 - 12:40 PM** (20 min): IRCTC navigation logic
  - Implemented reliable page loading with timeout handling
  - Added URL validation and redirect handling
  - Created element waiting mechanisms using WebDriverWait
  - Tested navigation reliability across multiple runs

- **12:40 - 1:00 PM** (20 min): Element detection framework
  - Developed robust element locating strategies
  - Implemented fallback selectors (ID ‚Üí Class ‚Üí XPath)
  - Added element visibility and clickability checks
  - Created debug logging for element detection issues

#### Code Milestones
```python
# Browser initialization with anti-detection
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled")
chrome_options.add_experimental_option("excludeSwitches", ["enable-automation"])

# Reliable navigation with error handling
def navigate_to_irctc():
    try:
        driver.get("https://www.irctc.co.in/nget/train-search")
        WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "search_btn"))
        )
        return True
    except TimeoutException:
        return False
```

#### Challenges Encountered
- **Dynamic Loading**: Elements appear 2-3 seconds after page load
- **Network Variability**: Page load times vary from 3-8 seconds
- **Element Selectors**: Some elements have dynamic IDs requiring flexible locators

#### Solutions Implemented
- Added 15-second timeout for critical elements
- Implemented retry mechanism for failed navigations
- Created element locator hierarchy (multiple fallback strategies)
